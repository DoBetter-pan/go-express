# go-express
Web frame created by Golang. It is the same structure as express in node.js. It is for easy to setup Web by Golang. It is a MVC web frame.   
# Why should you want this web frame?
- Jquery and Bootstrap are integrated into the go-express. But you can remove them from the go-express if you donot want to use them.
- Go-express is a light web frame for you to create a site. It have the easy-use and simple and powerful routes(controller).

I tested it in Ubuntu. If you are using other OS, it is the same way as in Ubuntu. Please try.
## Develop:
I wrote a inline example: express. If you want to write a new controller, you can refer to these files.

    controller/expressController.go
    views/express/index.html
    views/express/about.html 
If you want to change the main template, you can change the following files.

    controller/mainController.go
    views/main/main.html
    views/main/header.html
    views/main/content.html
    views/main/footer.html 
# What should we do next?
Model is just a directory, not any file in it. It is not completely now. Go-express will support sql and no-sql database as data source.
